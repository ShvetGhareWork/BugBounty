            <p>
              Our Bug Bounty Program is an open initiative designed to
              strengthen the security and integrity of our digital services. We
              extend an open invitation to ethical security researchers,
              penetration testers, and cybersecurity enthusiasts worldwide to
              responsibly probe our applications and services for potential
              vulnerabilities. Through this initiative, we aim to foster a
              collaborative relationship with the global security community and
              continuously enhance the safety of our infrastructure.
            </p>

            <p className="mt-4">
              The program provides a transparent and rewarding platform where
              researchers can safely test and responsibly disclose security
              flaws they identify in our systems. We highly value the
              contributions of those who take the time to help us secure our
              platform, and we believe that by working together, we can create a
              more resilient, trustworthy environment for our users and
              partners.
            </p>

            <p className="mt-4">
              Our scope includes a wide range of assets: public-facing websites,
              mobile applications, cloud-hosted services, and backend APIs. We
              carefully define these assets to ensure researchers have clear,
              actionable targets while respecting operational safety and user
              privacy. In-scope assets may change as we expand our services, and
              the program dashboard will always reflect the latest updates.
            </p>

            <p className="mt-4">
              Participants in the program are expected to adhere to strict rules
              of engagement to ensure the safety and integrity of our systems
              and users. This includes avoiding actions that could cause
              disruption or harm, such as denial of service attacks, social
              engineering, or accessing sensitive user data. We also encourage
              researchers to halt any testing immediately if they encounter
              personal data and report it as soon as possible.
            </p>

            <p className="mt-4">
              Valid vulnerability reports will be rewarded based on a
              severity-based tier system aligned with industry standards like
              CVSS v3.1. The reward structure ranges from recognition on our
              public hall of fame to monetary rewards, depending on the impact
              and criticality of the reported issue. The aim is to recognize
              meaningful contributions while ensuring fair compensation for
              effort and expertise.
            </p>

            <p className="mt-4">
              Beyond financial rewards, top contributors may receive exclusive
              invitations to participate in private bounty programs,
              early-access beta testing, and cybersecurity workshops hosted by
              our team. We aim to cultivate an engaged, knowledgeable, and
              diverse security community that grows alongside our platform.
            </p>

            <p className="mt-4">
              Our security team is dedicated to triaging and addressing valid
              reports promptly. Every submission is reviewed and verified, with
              researchers receiving timely updates throughout the lifecycle of
              their report. We believe in fostering transparent communication
              and trust within the security community, and our disclosure
              timelines reflect a balance between protecting our users and
              acknowledging the contributions of researchers.
            </p>

            <p className="mt-4">
              We are excited to work with you in creating a safer, more secure
              digital experience for everyone. Whether youâ€™re a seasoned
              professional or an aspiring security researcher eager to make your
              mark, we invite you to participate and help shape the security
              future of our platform.
